# Thyroid Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict thyroid disease using clinical and laboratory data.

## Objective
To classify patients based on thyroid-related features and assist in early diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Handling missing values  
3. Feature selection  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Performance comparison using metrics  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  

## Results
The trained model demonstrates reliable performance in predicting thyroid conditions from structured medical data.

## Future Improvements
- Use advanced classifiers  
- Apply feature importance analysis  
- Add explainability techniques
